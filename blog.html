            <h2>Carrier Oils</h2>
            <p>Essential oils should never be used undiluted on the skin, and needs to be mixed with a carrier oil (also
                referred to as a base oil) to dilute the concentrated molecules, helps spread them over the surface of
                the skin, and helps deliver into the skin. This is done by diluting them in carrier oils. These oils are
                normally obtained by cold pressing and is inert - and not as volatile as essential oils. They are an oil
                made from the fatty portion of a plant, usually from the seeds, nuts or kernels.</p>
